\textit{In order to predict indoor locations by experimenting with all the different kinds of position estimation algorithms, it is fundamental to explore the theory behind each method. The different methods we investigate in this section are \gls{gbdt}, Neural Network methods such as \gls{ann} and \gls{rnn}, and lastly the \gls{imu} positioning method \gls{pdr}. Furthermore, a hybrid method will be explained and the theory behind such method.}
