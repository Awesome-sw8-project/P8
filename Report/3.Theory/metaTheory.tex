\textit{In order to experiment with all the different kinds of machine learning models in order to predict indoor locations, it is fundamental to explore the theory behind each method. The different methods we investigate in this section, are \gls{gbdt} tool lightGBM, Neural Network methods such as \gls{ann} and \gls{rnn}, lastly the \gls{imu} positioning method \gls{pdr}. However, a hybrid method will be explained upon and the theory behind such method.}
