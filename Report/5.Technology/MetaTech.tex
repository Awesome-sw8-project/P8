\textit{As the project which we are working on is an indoor positioning system and the motivation behind the project is to estimate and track the location of a user based on data from a smartphone, we also need to look at the concept of mobility, which is the overall theme of this project module. As explained in \autoref{sec:problemstatement} in \autoref{table:requirements}, the system we would like is to be an \gls{ips} for smartphones and is wanted to be deployable.  
In order to do so, we will explore the term mobility and what constrains that might have with our system. Afterwards, the architecture of our system will be explained and further investigated.}
