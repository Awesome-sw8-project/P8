\subsection{Constraints of Mobile-Software}

When developing mobile services and applications, there are multiple factors to consider. One of the issues is battery consumption, because mobile devices rely on their battery to keep working. Because many of the mobile devices are compact in size, they are often not equipped with massive batteries with long battery life. It is therefore important to focus on developing software that is not too power consuming. Another constraint is the bandwidth on mobile connections. Direct cable connections are usually faster than mobile broadband. The constraints with bandwidth can be improved through bulking operations, compression of information before transmitting, and caching.
