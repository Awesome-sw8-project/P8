\subsection{IndoorAtlas}

IndoorAtlas provides a SDK that integrates with a device and its sensors. It will gather information about the environment through WiFi, beacons or any other type of sensor, and it will compare this information with the movement of the user to the digital maps. The digital maps are produced by machine learning algorithms, and are used to find the user's precise location. Based on your hardware on your device, IndoorAtlas automatically chooses the best algorithms for your device and use case.
