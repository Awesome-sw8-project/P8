\section{Existing Systems}
In this section it will be discussed existing systems within navigation and positioning. First there will be investigated broader systems and/or companies that work with navigation and afterwards will be more specific in terms of indoor navigation. This section will contribute to what technologies that are used in practice when it comes to navigation. 

\subsubsection{Google}

\subsubsection{MapsPeople} % Too broad for section.
A system/solution that can be used speficily for indoor navigation is MapsPeople's platform MapsIndoors. MapsPeople specialises in indoor navigation and has been a google partner for +10 years. Other than the platform MapsIndoors, does MapsPeople also have expertise within Google Maps. 
There is not a specific technology they use for indoor finding, depending on time, budget and overall case. Some of the technology that they mention is Bluetooth beacons, WIFI positioning, positioning via magnetic fields and via lighting. \cite{mapsppl}

\subsubsection{Nearmotion} % Copied
Nearmotion is also a company that specializes in indoor navigation and has recently developed an \gls{ar} technology that can navigated you to a specific place indoors. However their main technology is the usage of Bluetooth beacons which sends radio signals to a smartphone which also is mentioned in \ref{}.\todo{indsæt ref} \cite{nearmotion}

\subsubsection{Steerpath} % Missing source, and beacons have already been covered enough.
Steerpath specializes in making buildings smart, meaning they transform building facilities into an interactive digital space with way finding. The way they handle the way-finding problem indoors, is, like MapsPeople, by beacons. 

\subsubsection{IndoorAtlas} % Too broad and has been covered.
With IndoorAtlas, they can make solutions for any kind of sensors that can be used to indoor navigation such as geomagnetic fields, WIFI signals, bluetooth beacons, barometric pressure and pedestrian dead reckoning, meaning the sensors in a smartphone.


\subsubsection{Partial Conclusion}
When looking at the existing systems, it is very clear that most companies use beacons in order to navigate indoors. However, still many of the companies, such as IndoorAtlas and MapsPeople, utilize a lot of different technologies, but are dependent on the costumers' case, in terms of money, time and usage.
